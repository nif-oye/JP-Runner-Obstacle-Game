This is a fast-paced side-scrolling game where players control a runner jumping over obstacles to stay in the game. Developed as part of the [Unity Learn Junior Programmer Pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer), this project showcases key Unity features like animation, particle effects, and collision handling to create a smooth and visually engaging gameplay experience.

## Features

- **Smooth Running & Jumping Animations:** Detailed animations make the runner's movements look realistic, with fluid transitions between running and jumping.
- **Challenging Obstacles:** Players must time their jumps carefully to avoid colliding with obstacles and losing the game.
- **Dynamic Particle Effects:** Dust particles kick up as the runner moves, adding a sense of speed, while collision effects make hitting obstacles visually impactful.
- **Collision Detection:** Unity's collision system is used to handle interactions with obstacles, triggering particle effects and game-over conditions.
